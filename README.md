# Trello4Unity
Trello4Unity is a Trello integration tool that allows a user to view, edit and create Trello cards from within the Unity Editor. 

# Origins

Trello4Unity was built off of an initial simple code base I found on Github (https://github.com/bfollington/Trello-Cards-Unity). The original code gave the user the ability to create cards via Unity. I built on this to add viewing, editing and creating cards, along with viewing and creating boards and lists.

I had some dialogue with the original creator and I have sent the changes I made to him so he can integrate them into the project and I will be named as co-author for it.
